1. Create different weapon types in the game
- currently there are 3 types of weapons PISTOL, MACHINE_GUN and ROCKET
- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change

Creating objects - focus on creational patterns

"different weapon types" - framework of different classes
"3 types of weapons" - 3 diff classes and have something in common like abstract classes
"in the future.. " - new classes

how do we write this solution
