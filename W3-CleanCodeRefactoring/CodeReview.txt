Code review

1. Code structure & naming conventions

- The package name is too generic; where is the module name?
- The class name is saying nothing;
- the function name is too generic;
- the function arguments names are not OK
- t and s must have meaningful names
2. Implementation

- Too many "magic numbers"(Hardcoded variables)
- is t limited to {1,2,3,4} or it can be bigger?
- there are no validations for t,s, and perioada
