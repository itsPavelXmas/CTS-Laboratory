1. Combination of camelCase and snakeCase
=> In java is preferred camelCase where as snakeCase is in Python, It wouldn't be clean to combine them in the same code.

2. Multiple variables were declared on the same line and it should be more cleaner to declare each variable on a single line.

3. Various methods are not straightforward and haven't been quite good chosen
=> They must be named after their purpose in code e.g "calculate" -> "calculateTotalFee".

4. Poorly spacing is observed, some have not spacing at all
=> I suggest it would be benefit and more readable to have an uniform spacing and to respect the coding in Java Conventions.

5. The Variables: STANDARD, BUDGET, PREMIUM would be more practice to store them in an Enum file called "AccountTypes".

6. There are unnecessary getter functions because the attributes of the class are public, because it doesn't respect the Encapsulation Principle
=> In order them to have a purpose in this code.. i made the attributes private.

7. There are few accessor methods are implemented
=> Because the attributes of the class were made private, best practice would be to implement all accessor methods.

8. The 'loan' and 'getRate' return the data and prints to the console a string which is not required.
=> It should only return the data.. in order to have a string printed to the console we have the ToString method.

9. There are useless comments that doesn't help us in the code 'The lead has requested it..'
=>The purpose of the comments in the code would be to offer you a pre Hint on what is about.

10. It is seen to have an Exception in 'setValue' and constructor that doesn't offer to much info regarding the problem in
=> That's why i've created a custom Exception to offer the user a hint.

11. It can be observed in the 'to_string' method that it must be camelCase 'toString' and also to be overridden(having the annotation '@override')

12. The use of 'this' keyword is not quite ok, is not consistent
=> it is recommended to use 'this' keyword only when we refer to the class attributes.

13. The constructor is situated at the end of the Class
=> The constructor should be placed  at the beginning of the class right after the class attributes.

14. The 'daysActive' attribute is not initialized and the 'malculate' method will return 0.
=>It must be initialized through the constructor.

****Calculate Method*****
15. In the 'calculate' method the code isn't well organized
=>the code must be written and organized in the same nature as the rest of the code respecting the Java conventions.
16. The 'temp' is never used soo it makes it useless for the method.
17. The 'i' must be spaced using tab.
18. Removed redundant variable 'Account account', it uses memory for nothing
=> used the element from the array for better clarity.
19. Instead of long coding regarding the if validation
=> Improved visibiliIty through implementing Two methods for comparing the 'AccountTypes'
20. The '0.0125' value is hardcoded
=>The best practice would be to organize it in a constant static variable to automatize the process.
21. In the for Loop it can be seen that is not ok spaced.
=> Putted some spaces :)
****************************
22. In the code can be seen that there are various print methods that do not offer useful information.
=> That's why i managed to implement an toString to combine all the output.

23.Not consistent use of the curly braces in the repetitive structures
=> All code block  must be placed between curly braces.
